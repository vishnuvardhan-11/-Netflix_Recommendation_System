"# Netflix_Recommendation_System" 🎬 Netflix Recommendation System A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users using cosine similarity and Naive Bayes models. The system is built with a clean Flask backend and an interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. The project includes end-to-end data preprocessing, model building, and deployment.

🚀 Features 🎯 Content-Based Filtering using:

Cosine Similarity

Naive Bayes Classification

🧹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:

Handling missing data

Feature extraction (e.g., genres, cast, keywords)

🌐 Frontend:

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Simple and intuitive UI

🛠️ Backend:

Built using Flask

RESTful API architecture for recommendations

💾 Model Saving for fast response

🧪 Tested on realistic datasets with consistent performance
